        With more than 13 million residents to entertain, Tokyo has a lot going on. Start your morning off with breakfast sushi at the world-famous Tsukiji Fish Market then let yourself get lost in Japan's vast and interesting history at the Tokyo National Museum or the Edo-Tokyo Museum. Take an hour or two and unwind in the verdant gardens (preferably with a picnic) of the Imperial Palace or the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. When you're ready to take on Tokyo's mammoth shopping scene, head to Ginza, the waterfront Odaiba or the anime-friendly Akihabara for all things tech. At the end of the day, take a lift into the sky at either the Tokyo Tower or the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building for a bird's-eye view of the glittering city. And no trip here would be complete without visiting some of the city's more traditional sites, including the Sensoji Temple and the spiritual Meiji Shrine.
